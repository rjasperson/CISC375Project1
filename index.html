			<p>My name is Ryan Jasperson and I'm a Senior at St. Thomas studying Computer Science. Some of my hobbies and interests include soccer, football, biking, eSports, and building electronic hardware. The photo below is of myself, my girlfiend, and some of my family members.</p>

			<p>In order to work on this project, I used HTML for the markup content, CSS to change the look and feel of the pages, and Javascript to add some functionality. I also used some Lightbox code from a handy online API called Lightgallery.
